Take a look at 
http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/1.5/tutorial.html,
https://samnicholls.net/2016/06/15/how-to-sphinx-readthedocs/, and
https://codeandchaos.wordpress.com/2012/07/30/sphinx-autodoc-tutorial-for-dummies/
For quick introductions to Sphinx.

The rest of the project toolchain can be installed from the file
requirements.txt by running `make init`

After installing the toolchain (see above) build documentation with
`make html`.  Then, you can view the documentation by opening
`/docs/_build/index.html`

see https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html#docstring-standard
on pydoc standard.  Follow this so that Sphinx can produce documentation.
